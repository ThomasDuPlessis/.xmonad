* My XMonad Configurations
This repo is my set up for XMonad.

MY XMonad and dzen configurations are Shamelessly ripped off from windelicato
who's original files are here: https://github.com/windelicato/dotfiles. I mostly
made some aesthetic changes as well as modified it for HIDPI (4k) screens.

My status bar (dzen) is configured for a 3200x1800 laptop (I'm currently on the
Dell XPS 13) and a 4k (3840x2160) monitor with mirroring on the desktop, not
extending.
