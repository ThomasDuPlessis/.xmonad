  [Panel Background] 
  
    
    A plasma theme for this suite is in the works, but in the meantime I've included a panel background to help complete the look.  
   
    
    1. Copy panel-background.svg to a location where it can stay permanently.  
   
    2. Select the plasma theme of your choice (I recommend Fushigi: http://kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=137517)
   
    3. Go to System Settings -> Workspace Appearance -> Desktop Theme -> and select your theme. 
   
    4. Click the Details tab.  For 'Panel Background' select File.. 
 
 
   
  [Stylish Theme]
 
    
    To improve the look of Firefox with this theme I've assembled a basic stylish scipt...  
    
    Make sure you have the Stylish extension installed: (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/)
    
    Then go to Firefox -> Addons -> Stylish and write new style titled AeriFixer.  
    
    Copy and paste the entire contents of AeriFixer_forFirefox to your newly created style, and save it.
